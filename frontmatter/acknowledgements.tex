\section{General acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my supervisors Thomas Schmidt and Bernd Braunecker for giving me the opportunity to work on this project, for their close collaboration on all the work I have done, and for the wisdom concerning physics, research and life that they have imparted on me. I would also like to thank my close collaborators Patrik Recher, Edvin Idrisov and Nathan Harshman for the countless invaluable insights they have shared with me.

I want to thank Johan Ekström, who has been a wonderful friend and indispensable companion inside and outside of academia since I met him on my first day in Luxembourg, as well as our common friends Nora Paulus and Nijat Hajikhanov, who made the years in Luxembourg into such an excellent adventure. 

I also want to thank my friends in St. Andrews, in particular Stephanie Matern for letting me take over her job, accomodations and friends when I arrived, Mari Cole for teaching me proper English and playing jazz with me, as well as Tobias Boorman and Joe Winter for being great friends to share an office and a pint with. A very special thanks goes out to Kristín Björg Arnardóttir, without whom I would never have survived the pandemic, and whose heartfelt support forms the very foundation of this thesis.

Furthermore, I must thank my family and friends in Denmark for helping me maintain my connection to home, and for hosting me on my many trips there.

Finally, as almost half the work on this thesis was done during the COVID-19 pandemic, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone mentioned above for helping me continue my work during lockdowns, travel restrictions and quarantines.
