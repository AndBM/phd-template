\chapter{Macroscopic quantum states}
\label{chap:macroStates}

The main system of concern in this thesis consists of two elements: a material exhibiting the \gls{QH} effect, and a \gls{SC}. Both of these are examples of ``macroscopic quantum states'', in the sense that they are both expressions of a macroscopic number of electrons condensing into a degenerate ground state at low temperatures.
